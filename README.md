# About me


**6nzdhr/6nzdhr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on university.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning rust, cpp, os, web, algorithm, English, linux, sql and a lot.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on study and maybe just for fun.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to get a job.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what I have learned and how I learned, to be honestly, I leared very slow.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 666nnnzzz@qq.com I seldom open it. Wish you don't need to reach me.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: A worker
- âš¡ Fun fact: Now I seldom have time, I readlly don't know.
